    """
    AI Guessing Game â€” Python
    Think of a number between 1 and 100, and the computer will try to guess it!
    This game adds a fun twist by combining randomness with binary search logic to surprise the player.
    Handles edge cases, user tricks.
    Instructions are provided as you play. Enjoy the game!
