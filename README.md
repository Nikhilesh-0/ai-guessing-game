# 🤖 AI Guessing Game

A fun Python game where the computer tries to guess the number you're thinking of — using a clever mix of randomness and binary search!

---

## 🎮 How It Works

- You think of a number between 1 and 100.
- The computer makes guesses, and you guide it by saying:
  - `'h'` → your number is **higher**
  - `'l'` → your number is **lower**
  - `'c'` → the computer guessed **correctly**
- Internally, the game mixes:
  - **Random guessing** (to surprise the user)
  - **Binary search** (to narrow down quickly)

It also handles edge cases where users try to trick the game 😉
